            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            
            <p>Hi! I am Christian Barlow, a 20-year-old guy from Castlegar, BC. I was born in Seattle, WA, USA.</p>
            
            <p>I picked up a hockey stick when I was 2, and played up until a couple years ago. Over the years, I would train by myself and with my team
            doing dryland, on-ice, and gym exercises.</p>
            
            <p>The ability to stay in good mental and physical shape for so long is <em>very</em> hard, but it
            is required for such a vigorous sport.</p>

            <p>A few years ago, I started making music and DJing at parties, as sort of my substitute for hockey.
            I have played all over the West Kootenays, and even opened for sold out shows in various spots of Washington.</p>
            
            <p>These concerts are amazing, 
            because I am able to meet the headliners, who are often people I have looked up to since a kid.</p>
            
            <p>Musically, I enjoy anything from country
            to classic rock to <strong>face melting death metal</strong> depending on my mood.</p>
